# Text Editor 

## User Story

As a developer

I want to create notes oir code snippets with or without an internet connection

So that I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I am presented with a text editor web application and can open the application in my editor and should see a client server folder structure.

* It is done I run 'npm run start' from the root directory and then I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client.

* It is done when I run the text editor application from my terminal then I find that my Javascript files have been bundled using webpack.

* It is done when I run my webpack plugins and find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.

* It is done when I use next-gen JavaScript in my application and I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.

* It is done when I open the text editor then I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.

* It is done when I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window and I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.

* It is done I reopen the text editor after closing it and find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.

* It is done when I click the Install button and I download my web application as an icon on my desktop.

* It is done when I load my web application and I should have a registered service worker using workbox.

* It is done when I register a service worker and I should have my static assets pre cached upon laoding along with subsequent pages and static assets.

* It is done when I deploy to Render and I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application.

## Description

The Text Editor Application is the backend layout for a user which allows the webpack applicaiton to run after using Render. The deployment through render allows users to edit and add information to the DB that is connected within the code.
